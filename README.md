I am an Intern in Prodigy InfoTech and i have copmleted the task using google colab  in 13 -15 days. 

Task 1 :Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Task Overview
while most accidents occur in good conditions when most driving happens, lighting, weather, and time of day are significant factors in accident risk. Adjusting for exposure, night driving, adverse weather, and certain geographic regions show elevated accident rates. Targeted interventions in these high-risk situations could yield safety improvements.

## Dataset
The Dataset used for this task is task 05.xlsx which is uploaded in the repository of PRODIGY_DS_05

## Conclusion
Continued monitoring and analysis of accident data will be crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and identify emerging trends. With a data-driven, multi-pronged approach, we can work towards the vision of zero traffic fatalities and serious injuries on our roadways.
